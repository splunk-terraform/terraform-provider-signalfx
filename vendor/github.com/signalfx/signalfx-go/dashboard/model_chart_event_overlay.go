/*
 * Dashboards API
 *
 * API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting dashboards and dashboard groups. <br> Dashboards are groups of charts. In a dashboard, all the charts that belong to the dashboard appear at the same time and follow the same filtering options. ## Dashboard layout The system lays out dashboards and the charts they contain with these dimensions: <br>   * The web UI reserves a 12x100 grid for each dashboard and assigns one or     more charts to specific locations within the grid.   * A chart associated with the dashboard can be any size from 1x1 to 12x3.   * If you assign overlapping dashboard locations for charts, the system     attempts to resize or reorganize the layout. This ensures that all     of the charts fit within the space alloted to the dashboard.  ## Dashboard access By default, all users in an organization can edit and delete dashboards and dashboard groups. If SignalFx has enabled the \"write permissions\" feature for your organization, you can limit editing or deleting of specific dashboards to specific individuals or teams, or both. Use this feature to prevent unauthorized or accidental modifications to dashboards and the charts they contain. ## Cloning dashboards Users who don't have permission to edit a dashboard can still clone it and modify the clone. ## View dashboards You can view dashboards you create using the API in the web UI by specifying their \"id\" property in a web UI URL, by following this syntax: <br> <code>https://app.signalfx.com/#/dashboard/&lt;DASHBOARD_ID&gt;</code> <br> Dashboards you create using the API also appear by name in the web UI catalog and in their dashboard group.

package dashboard

// An object that contains the settings for an event overlay applied to each chart in a dashboard. You specify the event overlays for a dashboard with two different properties:   * `CreateDashboardBody.EventOverlays`: Inactive event overlays that     you want to define for use at a laster time.   * `CreateDashboardBody.selectedEventOverlays`: Active event overlays     that you want to apply immediately to charts in the dashboard.
type ChartEventOverlay struct {
	// Controls the display of vertical event lines in the charts that belong to the dashboard. If `true`, the system displays event lines; otherwise, no event lines appear.
	EventLine   bool                 `json:"eventLine,omitempty"`
	EventSignal DashboardEventSignal `json:"eventSignal"`
	// The color used to display the event marker in charts. If you set `eventLine` to `true`, the system also uses this color for the event line it displays in charts. The value is an index into an array of 16 pre-defined colors shown in the following table:<br> <table> <thead> <th style=\"text-align:center;\">Index</th><th>RGB hex value</th> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td>0</td><td>#999999</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>#0077c2</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>#00b9ff</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>#6ca2b7</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>#b04600</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>#f47e00</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>#e5b312</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td><td>#bd468d</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>#e9008a</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td><td>#ff8dd1</td></tr> <tr><td>10</td><td>#876ff3</td></tr> <tr><td>11</td><td>#a747ff</td></tr> <tr><td>12</td><td>#ab99bc</td></tr> <tr><td>13</td><td>#007c1d</td></tr> <tr><td>14</td><td>#05ce00</td></tr> <tr><td>15</td><td>#0dba8f</td></tr> </tbody> </table> **Note:** Users may see colors other than those shown in the table, depending on the settings they select for color blindness. To see sample swatches of the alternate colors and the mappings used for color-blind users, refer to the color palette documentation at the end of the [Charts Overview](https://developers.signalfx.com/reference#charts-overview-1).
	EventColorIndex int32 `json:"eventColorIndex,omitempty"`
	// Text that identifies this event overlay in the dropdown menu you use to select an overlay for the dashboard
	Label string `json:"label,omitempty"`
	// Unique ID for this event overlay. Use this ID with any element of the `selectedEventOverlays` property to apply this overlay to a dashboard.<br> **Note:** The system generates this value if you don't specify one.
	OverlayId string `json:"overlayId,omitempty"`
	// An array of objects that specify filters to apply to events for this event overlay.
	Sources [][]EventOverlayFilter `json:"sources,omitempty"`
