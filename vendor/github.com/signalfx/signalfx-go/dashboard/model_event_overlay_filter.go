/*
 * Dashboards API
 *
 * API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting dashboards and dashboard groups. <br> Dashboards are groups of charts. In a dashboard, all the charts that belong to the dashboard appear at the same time and follow the same filtering options. ## Dashboard layout The system lays out dashboards and the charts they contain with these dimensions: <br>   * The web UI reserves a 12x100 grid for each dashboard and assigns one or     more charts to specific locations within the grid.   * A chart associated with the dashboard can be any size from 1x1 to 12x3.   * If you assign overlapping dashboard locations for charts, the system     attempts to resize or reorganize the layout. This ensures that all     of the charts fit within the space alloted to the dashboard.  ## Dashboard access By default, all users in an organization can edit and delete dashboards and dashboard groups. If SignalFx has enabled the \"write permissions\" feature for your organization, you can limit editing or deleting of specific dashboards to specific individuals or teams, or both. Use this feature to prevent unauthorized or accidental modifications to dashboards and the charts they contain. ## Cloning dashboards Users who don't have permission to edit a dashboard can still clone it and modify the clone. ## View dashboards You can view dashboards you create using the API in the web UI by specifying their \"id\" property in a web UI URL, by following this syntax: <br> <code>https://app.signalfx.com/#/dashboard/&lt;DASHBOARD_ID&gt;</code> <br> Dashboards you create using the API also appear by name in the web UI catalog and in their dashboard group.

package dashboard

// Object containing a filter to apply to event overlays, in the form of a comparison expression. Each term in the expression tries to match the values of a dimension or custom property to criteria you specify. Based on the match results, you can include or exclude an event.
type EventOverlayFilter struct {
	// Controls the action of the filter. If set to `true`, then the system only selects events that *don't* match the filter.
	NOT bool `json:"NOT,omitempty"`
	// The custom property or dimension name that provides the value to test in the filter.<br> If the name you specify isn't defined in one or more of the events associated with the dashboard, the filter never matches anything. If the `NOT` property for this filter is set to `true` and the filter never matches, all event overlays are suppressed.
	Property string `json:"property"`
	// An array of values to test against the specified property. If any of the values match, the system includes the event.<br> **Note:** You must specify at least one element.
	Value StringOrSlice `json:"value"`
}
