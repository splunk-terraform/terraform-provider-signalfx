# Resource: signalfx_dashboard_group

In the Splunk Observability Cloud web UI, a [dashboard group](https://developers.signalfx.com/dashboard_groups_reference.html) is a collection of dashboards.

Dashboard groups cannot be accessed directly. You can access them through a dashboard within a group.

~> **NOTE** When you want to change or remove write permissions for a user other than yourself regarding dashboard groups, use a session token of an administrator to authenticate the Splunk Observability Cloud provider. See [Operations that require a session token for an administrator](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/administration/authtokens#Operations-that-require-a-session-token-for-an-administrator).
